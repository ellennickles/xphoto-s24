# Feb 15 • Week 4 • Alternative Shutter Buttons 1

> A short time since the Scientific American briefly noted the fact that Mr.

> photographs, **Mr. Muybridge employed a series of cameras, operated by
> electricity**, and so placed as to fix with absolute accuracy the several
> phases in the continuous action of the horse while making one stride. The
> exposure for each negative was about the two thousandth part of a second. (“A

## Questions

- What are alternative ways to trigger the capture of photographs?
- How can we start to work with sensors that are measuring changes in the
  physical world as shutter buttons?

## Assignment due Wed Feb 21

[How to get full credit on weekly
assignments](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s24/tree/main#assessment-and-evaluation)

### Part 1 • Experiment / Reflect (Partners Optional)

- Continue to work in **black and white** again. Take a series of images
  triggered by a sensor connected to your Arduino or similar microcontroller. Is
  the sensor that is triggering the capture the result of a change (or
  inactivity) in the environment or in response to an action (or reaction) of
  the body? Is the triggering active or passive? How does the choice of sensor
  and its context in the world contribute to the intentions or expressions of
  the image? The only rule is: no buttons or toggle switches on your Arduino to trigger captures.
- Choose one of the images to submit for your assignment, along with a link to
  the code. Write a short reflection on your process and results. What does the
  image show? Why do you like the image? What qualities do you observe (see
  [Elements of a
  Photograph](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s24/tree/main/resources))?
  What did you have trouble with? What would you do differently next time?
  Describe the experience of creating the images? What did you feel? What was
  surprising, enjoyable, or challenging?
- If you work with a partner, each person needs to submit their own assignment.
- Submit your response on
  [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/344680).

### Part 2 • [Read](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qIvZPNF94dAizOjOpymky5bexo8bdELj) / Respond

- Read “Color Theory for Photographers: An Introduction” by Chelsea London
  (2018).
- Let's start talking about color. You can find a great deal of information
  online about color theory for photographers, and the reading is an
  approachable and comprehensive overview. Following the examples in the
  reading, find or photograph (using any camera you want) images for each of
  these color schemes: monochrome, analogous, and complimentary.
- Post the three images on your blog along with a short description about how
  color contributes the composition. How does color move your eye through or
  around the images? Does color contribute to the mood or energy of an image for
  you? Does it work to emphasize a particular aspect of the photograph? (If you
  use others' images, be sure to give credit and link back to the source!)
- Include at least one (1) question for discussion or further reflection.
- Submit your response on
  [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/344680).

### Part 3 • Bring to class

- Bring your Arduino kit back to class next week.

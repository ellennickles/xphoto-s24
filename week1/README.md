# Jan 25 • Week 1 • What is photography?

>The enemy of photography is the convention, the fixed rules of "how to do." The salvation of photography comes from the experiment. ([Lászlo Moholy-Nagy](https://photographyandvision.com/2021/03/15/monday-photography-inspiration-laszlo-moholy-nagy/), 1940)

## Questions

- In what ways can we start to describe photography?
- How do photographs function in our lives?
- How has photography changed since it started?
- What does experimental mean in this course?

### Part 1 • Select / Experiment / Reflect

- Select a photograph that you did not take but enjoy looking at or is of the
  type of imagery that you would like to know more about. Write about the image.
  Describe what you see in the work. What does the image show? Does it tell a
  story? What qualities do you like best? What does it express? What choices did
  the photographer make to achieve these impressions and expressions? Why do you imagine the photograph was created?
- Experiment: try to recreate the image with a text-to-image AI image generation
  model of your choice. You are welcome to continue using the DreamStudio
  platform that we used in class (linked above). If that one doesn't work, then
  try the other version (also linked above). Remember that it's just an
  experiment! Reflect on the process. What prompts and settings were useful (or
  not) in achieving your goal? In your opinion, can text-to-image or
  image-to-image generators make photographs?
- Be prepared to share and talk about the images in our next class.
- Submit both images and your reflection on
  [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/344680).

### Part 2 • [Read](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qIvZPNF94dAizOjOpymky5bexo8bdELj) / Respond

- [The
  Rules](http://manifestos.mombartz.com/immaculate-heart-college-art-department-rules/)
  by [Sister Corita Kent](https://www.corita.org/) (1967-1968)
- [The Photographer’s
  Right](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qIvZPNF94dAizOjOpymky5bexo8bdELj?usp=drive_link)
  by Bert P. Krages II (2016)
- [ITP/IMA Code of
  Conduct](https://itpnyu.github.io/ITP-IMA-Code-of-Conduct/index)
- Our class engages in experimental practices and also provides space to share
  our work, engage with that of others, and cultivate ways of collaboratively
  providing feedback to promote awareness and discovery in our creative
  practices (i.e. what creative decisions are we making). We’ll talk more about
  this in class next week. To get started, based on the readings above and on
  your own experience during our recent workshop and elsewhere, write about ways
  to foster a class community in which it is safe to experiment with ideas and
  materials, as well as to share our results with one another.
- Be sure to include at least one (1) question for discussion or further
  reflection.
- Submit your response on
  [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/344680).

### Part 3 • Bring to class

- **p5** • Create a free [p5 web editor account](https://editor.p5js.org/) (if
  you don’t already have one).
- **USB to USB-C adapter** • If your computer only has USB-C ports, then you
  will need a **USB to USB-C adapter** to connect a Logitech webcam. **Please
  note: your adapter must be able to transmit data as well as power the
  camera.** These are also available from the ER, but they can be in high demand
  and sometimes unavailable to check out. Consider sharing with your classmates
  or purchasing your own: packs of 2 for ~$10 or less are frequently available
  on
  [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/JSAUX-Adapter-Compatible-MacBook-Samsung/dp/B07BS8SRWH/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=19JSU1Q8TES9N&keywords=USB%2BC%2Bto%2BUSB%2BAdapter%2Bjsaux&qid=1674232278&s=electronics&sprefix=usb%2Bc%2Bto%2Busb%2Badapter%2Bjsaux%2Celectronics%2C65&sr=1-1-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyVlJBRTVLWlNCMEw1JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwOTI0ODY2M1QzQVFRQ09ZT05ETiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMzMxNjUzMkpXTVMwWUFYWkhMQiZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU&th=1).

## Prepare for Weeks 4-5

- Starting Thu Feb 15, we'll use physical computing to create alternative
  shutter buttons. Here's a checklist to prepare. Especially with global supply
  chain issues and shipping delays these days, please don't wait until the last
  minute if you need to order anything.
- Gather the following materials:
  - Arduino (Uno or Nano 33 IoT depending on when you took Creative Computing)
  - Cables to connect your Arduino to you computer
  - Solderless breadboard
  - Jumper wires
  - Sensor(s) with which you have previous experience or are excited to use (but
    no buttons or toggle switches!)
  - Resistors and other components required for use with sensor(s) (check The
    Shop bins)
  - The [ITP/IMA Shop](https://shop.itp.io/) has some Arduinos and accessories
    available to check out
- Install the following app:
  - [Arduino IDE v2.0 or later](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (older
    versions should also work)
- Configure and test the IDE with your Arduino:
  - [Arduino
    Uno](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/getting-started/cores/arduino-avr)
  - [Arduino Nano 33
    IoT](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/getting-started/cores/arduino-samd)

  project is interactive, be sure to include video of the interaction.
- **Inspiration** • How did you become interested in this idea? Quotes,
  photographs, products, projects, people, music, political events, social ills,
  etc.
- **Process** • How did you make this? What did you struggle with? What
  were you able to implement easily and what was difficult?
- **Audience/context** • Who is this for? How will people experience it? Is it
  interactive? Is it practical? Is it for fun? Is it emotional? Is it to provoke
  something?
- **Code references** • What examples, tutorials, references did you use to
  create the project?
- **Next steps** • If you had more time to work on this, what would you do next?
- If the project is a collaboration, each person is expected to submit a post
  documenting their contributions.

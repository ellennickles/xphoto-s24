# Feb 8 • Week 3 • Multiple Cameras, Simultaneous Captures

> A photograph, while recording what has been seen, always and by its nature
> refers to what is not seen. It isolates, preserves, and presents a moment
> taken from a continuum…. The only decision [the photographer] can take is as
> regards the moment [they] choose to isolate. Yet this apparent limitation
> gives the photograph its unique power. What it shows invokes what is not
> shown. (John Berger, Understanding a Photograph, 1968)

## Questions

- How can we use our [Questions for
  Discovery](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s24/blob/main/resources/questions-for-discovery.md)
  as tools to draw awareness to and articulate how we read photographs?
- What is Cartier-Bresson’s “decisive moment”?
- How does that idea compare to Nick Waplington's "indecisive memento"?
- How can we work with multiple cameras in p5 to capture a moment from
  multiple angles simultaneously?

## In class

- Practice Questions for Discovery
- Share homework
- Related work
- Discuss decisive moments and indecisive mementos
- Workshop: Multiple Cameras, Simultaneous Captures
- Demos: Additional “webcam” options

## Assignment due Wed Feb 14

[How to get full credit on weekly
assignments](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s24/tree/main#assessment-and-evaluation)

### Part 1 • Experiment / Reflect

- Capture multiple images of a scene from **at least two (2) to three (3)
  different angles** (or more!) simultaneously and in **black and white**.
- Maybe play with cause and effect, action and reaction, before and after? Or
  something completely different. Is the scene from a story, a mystery, a
  sensation? Is it a spontaneous or planned event? Consider the five senses,
  e.g. is it a loud moment or a quiet one? Decisive or indecisive?
- Another option, build off of the "Sum of the Parts" assignment from
  Carlo Van de Roer in *The Photographer's Playbook*, edited by Jason Fulford and
  Gregory Halpern (2014), p. 355: "Make two photographs that you feel convey a
  particular subject when they are viewed together, but that do not convey the
  same subject when they are viewed separately. This is a way of including the
  viewer in the creation of meaning in your work. The subject could be an
  experience, idea, piece of writing, or word. Try to choose something that is
  of interest to you personally."
- Consider how you want to display the final photographs. The arrangement can be
  completely different from how you drew the photos to the Canvas at the moment
  of capture, i.e. you can configure them as you see fit for the work.
- Submit the images along with a link to your code and write a short
  reflection on your process and results. What do the images show? Why do you
  like the images? What qualities do you like best (see [Elements of a
  Photograph](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s24/blob/main/resources/photograph-elements.md))?
  What did you have trouble with? What would you do differently next time?
  Describe the experience of creating the images? What did you feel? What was
  surprising, enjoyable, or challenging?
- Submit your response on
  [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/344680).

### Part 2 • [Read](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qIvZPNF94dAizOjOpymky5bexo8bdELj) / Respond

- Read “The Annihilation of Time and Space” in *River of Shadows* by Rebecca
  Solnit, pp. 1-24  
- Did anything surprise you about this reading? What do you want to know more
  about? It's been about 150 years since Muybridge’s Horse in Motion series, and
  now electricity and photography are ubiquitous. What currently emerging
  technologies do you predict could prevail in the future?
- Be sure to include at least one (1) question for discussion or further
  reflection.
- Submit your response on
  [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/344680).

### Part 3 • Bring to class

- Please bring your webcam back to class to return to Ellen.

## Prepare for next week (Week 4) and Week 5

- Starting Thu Feb 15, we'll use physical computing to create alternative
  shutter buttons. Here's a checklist to prepare. Especially with global supply
  chain issues and shipping delays these days, please don't wait until the last
  minute if you need to order anything.
- Gather the following materials:
  - Arduino (Uno or Nano 33 IoT depending on when you took Creative Computing)
  - Cables to connect your Arduino to you computer
  - Solderless breadboard
  - Jumper wires
  - Sensor(s) with which you have previous experience or are excited to use (but
    no buttons or toggle switches!)
  - Resistors and other components required for use with sensor(s) (check The
    Shop bins)
  - The [ITP/IMA Shop](https://shop.itp.io/) has some Arduinos and accessories
    available to check out
- Install the following app:
  - [Arduino IDE v2.0 or later](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (older
    versions should also work)
- Configure and test the IDE with your Arduino:
  - [Arduino
    Uno](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/getting-started/cores/arduino-avr)
  - [Arduino Nano 33
    IoT](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/getting-started/cores/arduino-samd)

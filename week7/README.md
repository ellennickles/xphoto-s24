# Mar 6 • Week 7 • AI Camera

> AI's integration into photography has expanded its capabilities
> beyond simply capturing and recording light, and transformed it into a
> process that involves the creation and manipulation of light itself. The
> resulting work transcends what was previously unimaginable, introducing new
> dimensions of creativity that would be impossible to achieve without the aid
> of AI. This powerful collaboration between human vision and AI-driven tools
> opens up a world of possibilities, allowing photographers to craft images
> that break through the limitations of traditional photography and showcase
> the true potential of this evolving medium. ([PUBLIKFRUIT in
> conversation with Plutonium Fitzgerald](https://postphotography.xyz/ppp2/in-conversation/publikfruit), *Post Photographic Perspectives II*, Acceptable

assignments](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s24/tree/main#assessment-and-evaluation)

### Part 1 • Experiment / Reflect

- Retell a short story, perhaps your favorite fairytale or folktale, with a
  sequence of at least five (5) photorealistic images generated by AI using
  Midjourney.
  - Be intentional about how you "shoot" your scenes. In addition to the
    subjects, actions, and settings, consider other elements such as focal
    length (field of view), shutter speed, aperture (depth of field), the camera
    shot and angle, the type of lighting, and color palette to convey the
    narrative with a specific style and mood.
  - You don't have to use all the prompts practiced in class. Use the prompts in
    the class slides as a starting point to find a combination of text
    descriptors and parameters to generate results of interest to you. Feel free
    to add more descriptive words to flush out the subject / action / setting
    with more detail.
  - Consider playing with variations of the same combination of text
    descriptors in your prompts to achieve stylistic consistency across your
    series and adjust the camera position, lighting, etc. for different scenes, for example.
  - Use the resources linked above for insight and inspiration.
  - Feel free take creative liberty with the story, e.g. What if your main
    subject/s is/are not human?
- Submit your images, and write a reflection on your process and results. What
  do the images show? What qualities did you aim to include in the images and
  for what purposes (see [Elements of a Photograph](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s24/blob/main/resources/photograph-elements.md))? What
  did you have trouble with? What would you do differently next time? Describe
  the experience of creating the sequence? What was surprising, enjoyable, or
  challenging? Remember to include the [proper
  citation](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s24?tab=readme-ov-file#generative-ai-tools)
  for your AI-generated images as described in our syllabus.
- Submit everything on
  [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/344680).

### Part 2 • [Read](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qIvZPNF94dAizOjOpymky5bexo8bdELj) / Respond

- Read the augmented reality (AR) text, *Voidopolis*, by Kat Mustatea:
  - Read the "Artist Statement: The Book You Are Holding Was Made to Disappear",
    pp. 1 - 16.
  - Read "How to Activate and Read Voidopolis", p. 21.
  - Read an excerpt of the text itself from pages, Manhattan / July 1 to
    Coney Island--Brooklyn / September 18.
  - This text, among many other things, is a retelling of Dante's *Inferno*.
    Here's a [quick video synopsis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE5ihycCq54)
    if you're not familiar with it.
- Describe your experience reading this work. How does it compare to reading a
  text in a traditional book form? In what ways do you find meaning with this
  work? For this question consider *what* is represented (content) and *how* it
  is represented (form)? How does the use of AR compare with your experiences of
  other applications of AR in the world? What does this work suggest about the
  role of AR in enhancing or detracting from the human experience? Use specific
  examples from the text to support your answer.
- Next week the book's author, transmedia playwright and artist Kat Mustatea,
  will visit our class to discuss the reading. Come up with at least one (1)
  question to ask her during her visit. **Make sure that your question cannot be
  answered in the book's "Artist Statement".** Include this question in your
  reading response.
- Submit your response and question for Kat on
  [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/344680).

### Part 3 • Prepare for next week

1. Next week we will explore photography through augmented reality (AR).
  Please install a free copy of the [Adobe Creative
  Suite](https://itp.nyu.edu/help/free-copy-of-adobe/) on your computer and
  download the apps, **Aero** and **Photoshop**.
2. Please also install the Adobe Aero mobile (Apple iOS) or the Adobe Aero
   Player (beta) for Android on your mobile device. [Here is a list of supported
   mobile
   devices](https://helpx.adobe.com/aero/system-requirements.html).
   If your device is not supported, then please let Ellen know **before class
   next week**, and we'll check out some iPads from the ITP/IMA ER to use in class.

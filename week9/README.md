# Mar 28 • Week 9 • [Photobooth](http://www.photobooth.net/wp/archive/2023/11/02/PhotoboothConventionSpellingDecision.pdf) 1

> The person who sits down in a photobooth and drops their coins into the slot
> becomes the art, no matter what they do... There is something uniquely magical
> and completely spontaneous that happens behind the curtains in these
> simultaneously most private and most public of art-making locales. (Mark
> Bloch, "[Behind the Curtain: A History of the
> Photobooth](http://www.panmodern.com/photobooth.htm)", 2012)

## Questions

## Assignment due Wed Apr 3

[How to get full credit on weekly
assignments](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s24/tree/main#assessment-and-evaluation)

### Part 1 • Experiment / Reflect (Partners Encouraged!)

- We can make our own photobooths with code. The fact that we can do this
  on our computers means that we can introduce new constraints or change the
  traditional ones that you observed in your research last week. These changes
  can be social, environmental, and computational interventions (see the
  examples in this week's slides).
- Design at least one intervention for your own custom photobooth. Aim for a
  clear theme or personality. _Can you make an opinionated photobooth?_
- Use the starter sketches linked above to help you.
- Consider checking out an external webcam from the ER for increased
  flexibility.
- This is a two-week assignment. Next week, you’ll test your photobooth in
  class.
- Include the following in your reflection:
  - give your photobooth a working title;
  - describe your intervention (why did you choose this particular constraint?);
  - what you will test in class next week?;
  - describe any technical difficulties and anything you’re not sure about;
  - a link to your code;
  - some test shots from your photobooth ahead of next week’s class.
- Submit your reflection on
  [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/344680).

### Part 2 • [Read](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qIvZPNF94dAizOjOpymky5bexo8bdELj) / Respond

- Read the following sections of *Photobooth: The Art of the Automatic Portrait*
  by Raynal Pellicer: "The Artist in the Photobooth" and "The Second Life of the
  Photomaton," pp. 87-245 (mostly pictures).
- Keep in mind that these artists were working with constraints that were
  perhaps quite similar to what you observed in your research last week. In
  addition, they couldn't necessarily modify or make their own photobooth.
- Whose work stands out to you and why does it resonate? Select at least one of
  the artists for your response. Is there anything in their approach or work
  that connects to your working idea for your photobooth intervention? If so,
  how? What do you think would be interesting to explore if you had the opportunity?
- Be sure to include at least one (1) question for discussion or further
  reflection.
- Submit your response on
  [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/344680).

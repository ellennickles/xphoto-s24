### Course Description

What are all the ways that you saw or made a photograph this week? How are those ways similar and different? How do those pictures function in your life and in society? What is a photograph? This course repeatedly asks these questions by using emerging computational tools to design alternative forms of making and interacting with photographs. The forms and applications of these tools, such as those for creative coding, physical computing, and machine learning, are explored weekly in technical tutorials and hands-on workshops. These are informed by discussions of critical debates in photography and various practitioners working with photographs, past and present. The homework includes readings, short writing responses, and photography assignments. Prerequisites: Comm Lab: HyperCinema (or similar coursework exploring communication and storytelling with digital tools) and New York’s IMA Creative Computing (or similar coursework with creative coding using the p5.js JavaScript library and programming for physical computing using Arduino microcontrollers). Note that prior experience with physical computing using the Arduino platform is required for this course. Please feel free to contact the instructor if you have any questions about the course.

### Learning Objectives

At the completion of this course, we will be able to:

1. describe the creative potential of emerging computational technologies in
   photography;
2. discuss historical and contemporary ideas about photography, including its
   tools and uses in the cultural landscape;
3. respond to these ideas by experimenting with the expressive possibilities of
   creative coding techniques, sensors, machine learning models, and other
   digital tools;
4. create alternative ways to engage in photographic practices using these
   tools.

### Format

Experimental Photography (XPhoto) is a 14-week course that meets once a week in
person at the scheduled times. Class time is structured as a mixture of homework
review, discussion, group work, lecture, demonstrations, and hands-on tutorials.
There are reading, writing, and creative assignments to do before each class.
You are expected to come to class with an open-mind, curiosity, questions, a
laptop, and any other supplies specified for the individual dates on the
schedule.

For the most part each class is organized into two parts. The first half will be
devoted to homework review to reflect on our work, develop our visual literacy
skills (reading and interpreting images), and co-create a visual learning
experience. The second half will be dedicated to technical workshops to
introduce new techniques to apply in our creative practices. In the mix will be
lectures and discussions about photography history and photographers, as well as
in-class activities to further engage with the ideas presented in the course.

### Community Guidelines

In keeping with the [ITP/IMA Code of Conduct](https://itpnyu.github.io/ITP-IMA-Code-of-Conduct/index), this course is committed to providing an inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space for everyone in our community. Harassment or discrimination in any form will not be tolerated, and this applies to any interactions and content.

#### Commitment to Diversity and Safer Spaces

We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may
challenge psychic, social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic
expressions. To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the different identities
and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use requested pronouns,
respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. Disagreement is
encouraged and supported, however, our differences affect our conceptualization
and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that
certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others
are undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more
protected or vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort
between the learners and instructor is needed to create a supportive learning
environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and
conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or
shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach the
discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one another.
Alternatively, if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a
piece of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with me.

### Communication and Support

#### Inside of class

During class, we will use [our Miro board](https://tinyurl.com/xphoto-s24-miro),
a free and online whiteboard with chat functionality to take notes, collaborate,
and share links and our photographs.

#### Outside of class

- You must check your NYU email for important updates about class.
- You are welcome to attend Student Hours in person or on Zoom. Links to sign up
  are posted above under Course Information.
- Use our course website here on GitHub to check the schedule (updated as needed
  based on our pace and interests), assignment descriptions, links to course
  materials including readings in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qIvZPNF94dAizOjOpymky5bexo8bdELj).
- Use [NYU Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu) to submit assignments and
  to receive written assignment feedback and grades.

#### Support

Your success in this class is important to me. We all learn differently and
require different kinds of accommodations. If there are aspects of this course
that prevent you from learning or exclude you in any way, I invite you to
communicate this with me. In addition, if you ever feel that you are struggling
with the material or falling behind for other reasons, please reach out to me.We’ll work together to ensure that you have proper support.

Additional forms of support:

- Meet with our course graduate assistant.
- Look out for the ITP/IMA residents' [office
  hours](https://itp.nyu.edu/help/office-hours/).
- Visit [The Coding Lab](https://itp.nyu.edu/help/in-person-help/coding-lab/) to
  ask ITP student mentors about code.

Tips for asking for technical help:

- Clearly describe what you want to happen and what is happening instead.
- Give enough information in order for someone to recreate the problem.
- If applicable, provide a link to the code itself.

#### Stay in touch

When in doubt, it’s ALWAYS better to contact me sooner rather than later about
attendance, assignments, or anything else on your mind.

### Tools

#### Hardware

- You will need a modern laptop. Four years old or younger is a good rule of
  thumb. Limited numbers are available for checkout from the ITP/IMA Equipment
  Room (ER) and must be returned by the end of the day.
- Cameras (Weeks 2-3)
  - We will use external camera devices with our laptops. USB Logitech webcams
    will be demonstrated in class, and I will check out a class set of cameras
    from the ER for our class to use. Additional cameras are available to check
    out from the ER for 24-hour reservations.
  - If your computer only has USB-C ports, then you will also need a **USB to
    USB-C adapter** to connect a Logitech webcam. **Please note: your adapter
    must be able to transmit data as well as power the camera.** These are also
    available from the ER, but they can be in high demand and sometimes
    unavailable to check out. Consider sharing with your classmates or
    purchasing your own: packs of 2 for ~$10 or less are frequently available on
  [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/JSAUX-Adapter-Compatible-MacBook-Samsung/dp/B07BS8SRWH/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=19JSU1Q8TES9N&keywords=USB%2BC%2Bto%2BUSB%2BAdapter%2Bjsaux&qid=1674232278&s=electronics&sprefix=usb%2Bc%2Bto%2Busb%2Badapter%2Bjsaux%2Celectronics%2C65&sr=1-1-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyVlJBRTVLWlNCMEw1JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwOTI0ODY2M1QzQVFRQ09ZT05ETiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMzMxNjUzMkpXTVMwWUFYWkhMQiZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU&th=1).
- Physical Computing (Weeks 4-5)
  - If you're an IMA student, expect to use the Arduino kit from your Creative
    Computing class. Depending on when you took Creative Computing, this might
    include an Arduino Uno or Nano 33 IoT. Either one will work. Arduino Unos,
    Nano 33 IoTs, and Nano 33 BLE Senses (which will also work) are often
    available to check out from The Shop.
  - I recommend using sensors that you already have and with which you have
    previous experience. The Shop also provides some sensors to check out.
  - For general information on electronic components, sensors, their
    availability at ITP/IMA, and where to purchase them see the [ITP Physical
    Computing Parts and Tools Guide](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/resources/parts-and-tools-guide/).

### Assessment and Evaluation

Course assessments take the form of weekly assignments, a final project, and
participation and attendance. Check the schedule above for links to the assignments.

It is expected that you will spend six to eight (6-8) hours a week on the course
outside of class itself. This will include reviewing material, reading and/or
watching videos, writing responses to the readings, and completing the
photography experiments and reflections. Please budget your time accordingly.

#### Photography Experiments and Reflections

Each week you'll explore the possibilities of various technical and conceptual
decisions in a photographic creative exercise. You are expected to post
your photographs in Brightspace, a link to your code (if applicable), and write
a short (100 words minimum) reflection about your experience. The intention of
these reflections is to help you develop an awareness of your creative choices
over time and note any technical complications.

##### Grading Rubric for Photography Experiments and Reflections

Photography experiments and reflections are worth four (4) points, one (1) point for each of the following:

1. The exercise addresses the creative prompt (100 words minimum);
2. demonstrates evidence of experimentation with results that are distinct from
   the examples and other projects;
3. reflects on your resulting images and your experience of making them (e.g.
   What does/do the image/s show? What qualities do you like best? Consider
   framing, lighting, composition, and content, etc. What did you have trouble
   with? What would you do differently next time? Describe the experience of
   creating the image/s? What did you feel? What was surprising, enjoyable, or challenging?);
4. is submitted on time.

For any assignment that uses code, not properly citing code sources is grounds
for receiving a zero (0) on the assignment. For more information, see the
statement below on the Use of Free and Open Source Materials Including Code.

#### Reading Responses

Each week each you are to write a short (200 words minimum) written response to
the assigned reading and prompt in Brightspace. The intention of these responses
is to provide you with the opportunity to consider the course content at your
own pace and in your own words, and to prepare for upcoming, related in-class
discussions and activities.

##### Grading Rubric for Reading Responses

Written reading responses are worth four (4) points, one (1) point for each of the following:

1. The response addresses the reading prompt (200 words minimum);
2. includes a position, opinion, and/or proposal that does not merely summarize
   what others have said, but represents your own thoughts even if they are
   tentative;
3. includes at least one (1) question to bring to our group for discussion;
4. is submitted on time.

#### Final Project

The course will culminate with the completion of a final project to be shared in
class. You are expected to push your abilities to produce something that builds
off or is inspired by the concepts explored during the semester. For the final
project you are expected to present a project proposal, create a working
prototype to share for peer feedback, and present a completed final project to
our class. More information will be provided later in the semester.

##### Grading Rubric for Final Project

Specific grading criteria for each stage will be provided later in the semester.

#### Assignment Deadlines

All assignments are required, and unless otherwise stated, are **due the night before our class meets**, one (1) week after they are assigned. Assignments turned in late will receive partial credit, as described in the grading rubrics above.

#### Late Assignments

Late assignments will be accepted for partial credit. If you anticipate any challenges meeting the assignment deadlines, please reach out to me so that we can consider your options together. The last day to submit late work for partial credit is Monday, May 6, 2023, at 12:00pm (noon).

#### Extensions

An assignment extension may be granted upon request. If you request an
extension, your grade will not be affected. However, if you do not request an
extension, the grading rules above apply.

#### Written Feedback and Grades

Assignments will be evaluated on timeliness, completeness, and engagement with
the course materials to explore ways of expressing your own points of view. The
rubrics above are adapted from
[source](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1464145/pages/grading-rubric-for-reading-responses).
The goal is to post written feedback and assignment grades in Brightspace within
a week of an assignment's due date.

#### Midsemester Progress Report

Your progress at midsemester will be evaluated as Strong Progress,
Satisfactory Progress, or Concerns about Progress:

- Strong Progress in this course means consistently participating in the
  classroom (see ways to participate below) and completing all your weekly
  photography experiments and reading responses to meet most of the grading
  criteria as described in the provided rubrics above.
- Satisfactory Progress means sometimes participating in the classroom and
  completing most of your weekly photography experiments and your reading
  responses but not always fully.
- Concerns about Progress means not participating in the classroom regularly
  and regularly missing your weekly photography experiments and reading
  responses. Multiple absences will also raise concerns about progress.

#### Final Course Evaluation

The final course evaluation will be based on participation and attendance and the completion of all assignments, including the final project, according to this breakdown:

- 30% Participation and attendance
- 25% Photography experiments and reflections (10 * 2.5%)
- 25% Written reading responses (10 * 2.5%)
- 20% Final project (5% proposal, 5% prototype, 10% project and presentation)

This class uses the standard A through F letter grading system, and grades will be determined according to this criteria:
92.5 - 100% A,
90.0 - 92.5% A-,
87.5 - 90% B+,
82.5 - 87.5% B,
80 - 82.5% B-,
77.5 - 80% C+,
72.5 - 77.5% C,
70 - 72.5% C-,
67.5 - 70% D+,
62.5 - 67.5% D,
60 - 62.5% D-, and
0 - 60% F

In general, A indicates excellent work, B indicates good work, C indicates satisfactory work, and D indicates passable work and is the lowest passing grade. F indicates failure. There are some additional grades: P for Pass and  W for Withdrawal—which are granted administratively. Please note that IMA majors need a C or higher to satisfy their IMA requirements, i.e. receiving a D will not count for credit towards the IMA major.

### Policies

#### Participation

This class is highly participatory, and there are many ways to demonstrate your
engagement with the course material and with your peers:

- show up on time with curiosity;
- ask and answer questions;
- follow instructions;
- engage in group activities;
- share your photography experiments for group review;
- engage in your classmates’ review sessions;
- contribute to class discussions (use the weekly reading responses to prepare);
- support and help your fellow classmates during discussions and technical
  workshops;
- unless otherwise directed, stow devices away and mute any notifications
  unrelated to class.
- attend student hours;

#### Absences

Attendance is mandatory. If you think you will be absent, please contact me
before class unless circumstances make this truly impossible. If you're feeling
unwell, please know that I do not require the details of your condition nor any
proof / doctor's note from a medical office.

At most two (2) unexcused absences will be tolerated without affecting your grade. Any more than two (2) unexcused absences will result in a lowering of your final grade by one whole grade for each unexcused absence. For example, three (3) unexcused absences will result in your highest possible grade being a B instead of an A. Four (4) unexcused absences will result in your highest possible grade being a C and so on. Six (6) unexcused absences would result in an automatic F for the course.

#### Lateness

You are expected to arrive to class on time and be ready to start at 9:00am ET.
An unexcused lateness of ten (10) minutes or more is equivalent to half (1/2) of
one unexcused absence. Two (2) late unexcused arrivals will count as one (1)
unexcused absence.

#### Eating and Drinking in the Classroom

To respect those with sensitivities to allergens, smells, and sounds, eating in
the classroom is not permitted. Drinks are okay.

### Statements

Unless other stated, these statements are adapted from the [ITP/IMA Equitable Syllabus Project](https://itp.nyu.edu/esp/).

#### Statement Of Principle

Instructors and learners work together to create a supportive learning
environment. The educational experience in the classroom is one that is enhanced
by integrating varying perspectives and learning modes brought by all learners.

#### Academic Integrity

The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members. It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice. Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards.

Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s original work as if it were your own.
More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own:

- a sequence of words quoted without quotation marks
- a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work
- ideas, sound recordings, computer data, or images composed or created by
  someone else
- content created by ChatGPT or other AI software

[Learners] are expected to build their own work on that of other people, just as
professional artists, scholars, and writers do. [Collaboration is highly valued
and often necessary to produce great work.] Giving credit to the creator of
the work you are incorporating into your own work is an act of integrity;
plagiarism, on the other hand, is a form of fraud. Proper acknowledgment and
correct citation constitute the difference. [Learners] should consult with
professors about the appropriate use of AI generated elements in artistic
projects.

*Excerpt adapted from the NYU Tisch School of the Arts [Policies and Procedures Handbook](https://tisch.nyu.edu/student-affairs/important-resources/tisch-policies-and-handbooks)*

#### Use of Free and Open Source Materials Including Code

You must cite the source of any material / code you use with the exception of
examples specifically provided by the instructor or demonstrated for the course.
Please note the following additional expectations and guidelines:

- **Check the license**. When using others' code, pay attention to the license
  under which it has been released, and be certain to fulfill the terms and
  requirements of those licenses. Descriptions of common licenses, and their
  requirements, can be found at
  [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/). Some licenses may require
  permission. If you are confused or aren’t sure how to credit code, ask one of
  the course instructors and make your best good faith effort. Not properly
  citing code sources is grounds for receiving a 0 on an assignment.
- **Use libraries**. The use of general, repurposable libraries is strongly
  encouraged. The people who developed and contributed these components to the
  community worked hard, often for no pay; acknowledge them by citing their name
  and linking to their repository.
- **Be careful**. It sometimes happens that an artist places the entire source
  code for their sketch or artwork online, as a resource from which others can
  learn. Assignments professors give in new media arts courses are often
  similar; you may also discover the work of a student in some other class or
  school, who has posted code for a project which responds to a similar
  assignment. You should probably avoid this code. At the very least, you should
  be careful about approaching such code for possible re-use. If it is necessary
  to do so, it is best to extract components that solve a specific technical
  problem, rather than those parts which operate to create a poetic experience.
  Your challenge, if and/or when you work with others' code, is to make it your
  own. It should be clear that downloading an artwork from someone's p5 account
  or GitHub and simply changing the colors would be disgracefully lazy. And
  doing so without proper citation would be outright plagiarism.

  Computation
  Course](http://cmuems.com/2018/60212f/syllabus/academic-integrity/) (Fall
  2018) at Carnegie Mellon University*

#### Generative AI Tools

When instructed, you are welcome and expected to use AI image generators (e.g.
DALL·E, Midjourney, DreamStudio by Stable Diffusion, etc.) in our course as
doing so aligns with our learning goal to experiment with the expressive
possibilities of image making with emerging computational technologies. You are
responsible for the information submitted based on an AI query (for example,
that it does not violate intellectual property laws, or contain misinformation
or unethical content). Your use of AI tools must be properly cited, which in this course means including the following in your documentation:
the name of the AI tool, the company that made the tool, the version/model of
the AI model used in the tool if available, the prompt you used to generate
content, the date the content was generated, and a general URL (link) to the
tool that you used.

Example citation for our course:

- DreamStudio by Stability.AI using model SDXL v1.0
- Prompt: "Red tulips in a red vase on a wood tabletop near a frosted glass

#### Title IX

Tisch School of the Arts is dedicated to providing its students with a learning
environment that is rigorous, respectful, supportive and nurturing so that they
can engage in the free exchange of ideas and commit themselves fully to the
study of their discipline. To that end, Tisch is committed to enforcing
University policies prohibiting all forms of sexual misconduct as well as
discrimination on the basis of sex and gender. Detailed information regarding
these policies and the resources that are available to students by visiting this
link to [Title IX at NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/equal-opportunity/title9.html).

#### Use of Electronic Devices

Laptops and other electronic devices are essential tools for learning and
interaction in classrooms. However, they can create distractions that hinder
students' ability to actively participate and engage. Please be mindful of the
ways in which these devices can affect the learning environment.

Activities not related to the class, such as recreational use of the internet,
including all social media websites, email and instant messaging, game playing,
and work for other classes, are not permitted. This includes recreational
use of phones, music players, video game systems. Such activities are
disrespectful to the instructor and distracting to others. Your devices should
always be closed whenever someone is presenting.

# Feb 29 • Week 6 • Networked Camera

> Our sense of spatial and temporal orientation has changed dramatically in
> recent years, prompted by new technologies of surveillance, tracking, and
> targeting. One of the symptoms of this transformation is the growing
> importance of aerial views: overviews, Google Map views, satellite views. We
> are growing increasingly accustomed to what used to be called a God’s-eye
> view. On the other hand, we also notice the decreasing importance of a
> paradigm of visuality that long dominated our vision: linear perspective. Its
> stable and single point of view is being supplemented (and often replaced) by
> multiple perspectives, overlapping windows, distorted flight lines, and
> divergent vanishing points. (Hito Steyerl, "In Free Fall: A Thought Experiment
> on Vertical Perspective," *The Wretched of the Screen*, 2012)

### Part 1 • Experiment / Reflect

- Pick a theme and curate a collection of at least ten (10) images from
  satellite and/or street view maps and/or open webcams. Be intentional and
  critical about why you are selecting the images and how you arrange them. How
  does grouping these particular images alter or extend their meanings when they
  are presented together as a set instead of separately?
- Possible inspiration
  - Examples in the class
    [slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qIvZPNF94dAizOjOpymky5bexo8bdELj?usp=drive_link)
  - Maybe your subject matter is a narrative (fictional or real) or
    documentation of site, event, or a question?
- Not sure which images to include in your collection? Refer to [Is it alive? On
  seeing what is right in front of
  you...](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s24/blob/main/resources/is-it-alive.md)
  by Joanne Dugan for some ideas.
- Submit your images. Arrange them as you see fit for the work. Write a
  reflection on your process and results. What do the images show? Why is it
  necessary to show them as a collection instead of individually? Why do you
  like the image? What qualities do you observe (see [Elements of a
  Photograph](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s24/blob/main/resources/photograph-elements.md))?
  If you're working in color, how are you considering color choices? What did
  you have trouble with? What would you do differently next time? Describe the
  experience of creating the collection? What did you feel? What was surprising,
  enjoyable, or challenging?
- Submit your images and reflection on
  [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/344680).

### Part 2 • [Read](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qIvZPNF94dAizOjOpymky5bexo8bdELj) / Respond

  - Respond:
    - The author of this article interviews four artists working with
      AI-generated images about the relationship between those types of images
      and photographs. Which of their opinions resonates most with you and why?
- Part 2 (DO NEXT): *[Post Photographic
  Perspectives](https://postphotography.xyz/ppp1/index-szn-1)* presented by

    - Or read the interview with the [show's
    curator](https://postphotography.xyz/in-conversation).
  - Respond:
    - What in their approach to using AI methods resonates with you, either
      positively or adversely? Why?
    - Select one of the artist's images from the show / interview and use your
      observations of the image to support your response.
    - Does this change your answer to Part 1's question above? How so?
- Be sure to include at least one (1) question for discussion or further
  reflection.
- Submit your response (including the artist's image that your selected) on

## Final Project Assignment

*Subject to updates as projects evolve

### Schedule

Your final project for this course is a three (3) week assignment to be completed in three (3) stages:

- Proposal (due next week, Week 12)
- Prototype to share in class for feedback (due Week 13)
- Presentation of the completed project (due Week 14)  

### Project Description

- This is an open-ended creative project that builds off or is inspired by the
  course topics. It can also veer into a new direction that we haven't explored
  together (some ideas below).
- You are expected to push your abilities to produce something that utilizes
  what you have learned, continues to explore questions you encountered during
  the course, and/or asks new questions about the nature of photography.
- The final project is worth 20% of your final course grade (5% proposal, 5%
  prototype, 10% implementation and presentation).

### Additional Notes

- Computation is not a required element for the final project. Choose the
    tools that make the most sense for your project.
- Final projects can be collaborations with anyone in any class. If you are
  collaborating with a partner or group, everyone is still expected document
  their work.
- Final projects can be one part of a larger project integrated with a different
  class.
- Keeping things simple and small in scope is a plus. If your project idea is a
  big one, consider documenting the larger idea but implementing just a small
  piece of it.
- Also think about making a final project for a small audience, even one single
  person like a family member or friend...or yourself. This can be a good way
  to focus your idea and design process. "Generalizing" the idea can come later (or maybe not at all).
- Use available resources on the floor! If you need assistance with long-term
  equipment loans to develop your project, let me know so I can help.
- If you need physical space on the floor to set up an installation, I can  help
  with that, too.

### Possible Ideas

- I encourage you to dream big and run wild with ideas. If you need inspiration,
  consider looking back at the record of questions you asked in your weekly
  assignments. Here are some possible directions, but you can also explore
  something entirely different!
- Be sure to check out examples from last year's student in the
  [Slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qIvZPNF94dAizOjOpymky5bexo8bdELj?usp=drive_link)
  for this week, too.
- **Make a book or zine** • Continue to develop one of your experiments from
    this semester and make book or zine of a sequence or series of photographs.
    There is a strong tradition of photobooks in photography. For context and
    direction, Jon Nicholls from the Thomas Tallis School created a useful
    lesson to answer the questions: [What is a photobook? Why has it been such
    an important part of the history of photography? How do you make
    one?](https://www.photopedagogy.com/the-photobook.html) The book or zine can
    take the form of a print or digital publication. There are A LOT of DIY
    resources online, but here are some that I've used in the past: Sea Lemon's
    [DIY Book
    Projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgejpUN_lrw&list=PL3AA6B7C8E6CE4AEF)
    and [DIY Bookbinding Methods and
    Stiches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkk_MhXeaac&list=PL2F704E01F80BA1E9)
    playlists, and if you can't get to Printed Matter's stores in the city, they
    have [curated, interactive
    tables](https://www.printedmatter.org/catalog/tables) to look into their
    book and zine catalog for content and construction ideas. Also take a look
    at [Printed Matter's Bookmaking Workshops with
    Yuchen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqr2p3OC544&list=PLjeNjJjJ6og08Hn87gjrF2Koca9kq-DsI).
    One more: [How to make a
    zine](https://thecreativeindependent.com/guides/how-to-make-a-zine/) by Rona
    Akbari. If you go this route, aim to bring a mock-up to class during Week 13
    to share for feedback.
- **Create an experimental online or XR gallery** • Continue to develop one of
    your experiments from this semester and present them on a website, Miro
    board?, or another platform that engages viewers in an unexpected ways. Are
    the images interactive, animated, temporary? Is there a specific sequence or
    nonlinear narrative? What images and details can we see or not see an at
    given moment? How does the flow and engagement with images connect to the
    larger ideas explored in the collection of images? If you go this route, aim
    to bring a mock-up to class during Week 13 to share for feedback.
- **Extend your photobooth** • We might expect a traditional photobook
    to fire off a succession of captures within a short amount of time after a
    brief countdown. How can you disrupt this idea? Is there an alternative
    shutter button? Does the photobooth wait patiently for the user to engage in
    a particular way? Or does it have a mind of its own? [More
    inspiration?](https://www.rencontres-arles.com/en/expositions/view/700/shoot)
    If you go this route, aim to bring a working prototype to class during Week
    13 to share for feedback.
- **Make a physical (interactive?) object or installation** • How can you push
    the ideas of photography through alternative physical forms? If you enjoy
    fabrication, then you might be interested these contemporary photographers
    whose work asks this question, often creating sculptural photographic
    objects. Possible inspiration: [Karen
    Navarro](https://www.karennavarroph.com/the-constructed-self), [Letha
    Wilson](https://www.lethaprojects.com/), [Alexandra
    Leykauf](https://www.instagram.com/alexandra_leykauf/?hl=en), Soo Kim's
    [Elysian](https://www.sookim.org/elysian/jb55tbno809a57na6w0ory2nystqgk) and
    [The DMZ](https://www.sookim.org/#/the-dmz/), [Takaai
    Akaishi](http://takaakiakaishi.com/installation%20views/installation%20view15.html),
    [Kate Steciw](https://higherpictures.com/artists/kate-steciw/), [Katja
    Novitskova](https://www.katjanovi.net/), and [Joiri
    Minaya](http://www.joiriminaya.com/dominicanwomengooglesearch). These
    examples, however, are not necessarily interactive. How can physical
    interaction alter how we engage with images? If you go this route, aim to
    bring a working prototype to class during Week 13 to share for feedback.
- These are just some ideas to get started! If you are unsure what to do, we'll
  brainstorm some ideas together.

## Assignment due Wed Apr 17

### Part 1 • Research Your Final Project Idea

- Next week you'll share you project idea and plan, and also ask our class
  questions for feedback. A best you can, describe what you intend to make and also the steps necessary to realize your idea
- Here are some suggestions of what to collect:
  - **Title and description** • Do you have an idea for a working title and/or a brief description of the final deliverable?
  - **Concepts** • Is there a theme, topic, question, or interaction driving
    your vision for the project?
  - **Inspirations** • How and why did you become interested in this idea?
    Reference any relevant projects, products, people, media, events,
    experiences, dreams, etc.
  - **Source material** • Do you have any drawings, images, videos, text, etc.
    to help make sense of your idea?
  - **Context/Audience** • Is there a story? Who is this for? Is it for you? How
    will people experience it? What kind of experience would you like people to
    have?
  - **Production** • What technical steps will you need to take to realize your
    idea?
  - **Code** • If you project uses code, do you have links to past projects,
    other people's projects, or examples?
  - **Questions for your classmates** • What are you unsure of conceptually
    creatively, or technically? On what aspect(s) would you like feedback?
  
### Part 2 • Prepare a Proposal and Presentation

- Write a post to share with the class in a five (5)-min presentation. Use
  the list above as an outline to illustrate what’s in your head.
- If you are collaborating with a partner or group, everyone is still expected
  to write a post and present for five (5) minutes each.
- This assignment is worth five (5) points: four (4) for describing your project
  proposal using relevant aspects of the list above and one (1) for submitting
  the post on time.
- Submit on
  [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/344680).

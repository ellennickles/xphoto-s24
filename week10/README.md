# Apr 4 • Week 10 • [Photobooth](http://www.photobooth.net/wp/archive/2023/11/02/PhotoboothConventionSpellingDecision.pdf) 2

> Artists love the photobooth for its immediacy...art in five minutes. It also
> has an element of nostalgia. Today, things are changing. There are still
> streamlined, curved photobooths around producing strips of four black and
> white pictures, but many machines are being converted to color or abandoned
> for the square-format color machines. We now have machines that will videotape
> you and your friends and machines that will give you a role of 35mm film ready
> to process, instead of the traditional photos! (Bern Boyle, "Photobooth
> History and Development", _Photomaton: A Contemporary Survey of Photobooth
> Art_, 1987)

### Part 1 • Experiment / Reflect

- xx
- Submit your images and your reflection on
  [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/344680).

### Part 2 • [Read](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qIvZPNF94dAizOjOpymky5bexo8bdELj) / Respond

- Read selected essays written by photographers from _Photographs Not Taken_,
  edited by Will Steacy with an "Introduction" by Lyle Rexer.
- As the editor notes in the "Preface":
  > Instead of looking out into the world through a camera lens, these essays
  > look directly into the mind's eye to reveal where photographs come from in
  > their barest and most primitive form--the original idea. These mental
  > negatives depict an unedited world that could not exist in a single frame.
- As we turn towards the final weeks of the semester, take a moment to reflect
  on what compels you to photograph by answering the question in the inverse:
  What's _your_ photograph not taken? Write your own short essay as if to
  contribute to collection.  
- Is there a moment that you wanted to photograph but could not for some
  reason? Was there a moment that got away? Or a moment that you chose not to
  photograph? Is there something that you cannot photograph? Are there limits to
  photography?
- Be sure to include at least one (1) question for discussion or further
  reflection.
- Submit your response on
  [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/344680).

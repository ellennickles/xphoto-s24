# Apr 4 • Week 10 • [Photobooth](http://www.photobooth.net/wp/archive/2023/11/02/PhotoboothConventionSpellingDecision.pdf) 2

> Artists love the photobooth for its immediacy...art in five minutes. It also
> has an element of nostalgia. Today, things are changing. There are still
> streamlined, curved photobooths around producing strips of four black and
> white pictures, but many machines are being converted to color or abandoned
> for the square-format color machines. We now have machines that will videotape
> you and your friends and machines that will give you a role of 35mm film ready
> to process, instead of the traditional photos! (Bern Boyle, "Photobooth
> History and Development", _Photomaton: A Contemporary Survey of Photobooth
> Art_, 1987)

## Questions

- How do we user test projects?
- What are additional computational interventions can we design into our
  photobooths?

## In class

- Photobooth user testing
- Workshop: Photobooth 2

## Assignment due Wed Apr 10

assignments](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s24/tree/main#assessment-and-evaluation)

### Part 1 • Experiment / Reflect

- Now that you’ve had a chance to practice using your photobooth in class,
  1. Refine your  computational, social, and/or environmental
    photobooth design intervention based on the feedback you collected in class.
    (If you missed this class, test your photobooth with a friend.)
  2. Use your photobooth with at least three new participants to take
     their portraits. TIP: there’s ALWAYS folks on our 4th floor willing to try
     projects!
- Include the following in your reflection this week:
  - your observations from our in-class user testing, i.e. what worked well?
    what was unexpected? what do you want to know more about? (If you missed
    this session, do some testing with a friend to gather this information.)
  - describe any design updates;
  - your photobooth's title;
  - a link to your code;
  - portraits from at least three new participants;
  - something you learned from your additional session(s) with your new users;
- If you work with a partner, each person needs to submit their own assignment.
- Submit everything on
  [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/344680).

### Part 2 • [Read](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qIvZPNF94dAizOjOpymky5bexo8bdELj) / Respond

- Read selected essays written by photographers from _Photographs Not Taken_,
  edited by Will Steacy with an "Introduction" by Lyle Rexer.
- As the editor notes in the "Preface":
  > Instead of looking out into the world through a camera lens, these essays
  > look directly into the mind's eye to reveal where photographs come from in
  > their barest and most primitive form--the original idea. These mental
  > negatives depict an unedited world that could not exist in a single frame.
- As we turn towards the final weeks of the semester, take a moment to reflect
  on what compels you to photograph by answering the question in the inverse:
  What's _your_ photograph not taken? Write your own short essay as if to
  contribute to collection.  
- Is there a moment that you wanted to photograph but could not for some
  reason? Was there a moment that got away? Or a moment that you chose not to
  photograph? Is there something that you cannot photograph? Are there limits to
  photography?
- Be sure to include at least one (1) question for discussion or further
  reflection.
- Submit your response on
  [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/344680).

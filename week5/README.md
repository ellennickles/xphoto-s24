# Feb 22 • Week 5 • Alternative Shutter Buttons 2

> [Marie] Cosindas approaches her subjects with a painter's eye, spending hours, for example, arranging flowers or other objects in her still lifes, then photographing them at long exposures in late afternoon light to obtain maximum color saturation and tonal contrast. In her portraits of friends and celebrities, such as Tom Wolfe and Louise Nevelson, or unknown models, the total environment is carefully considered. The colors and textures of the
subject's clothing, the fabrics and other objects which are part of the setting,
and the dramatic lighting are all designed to create a beautiful and compelling
image. (*Marie Cosindas: Color Photographs*, [Press
release](https://archive.org/details/cmapr3466/) from The Cleveland Museum of
Art, May 20, 1987)

## Assignment due Wed Feb 28

[How to get full credit on weekly
assignments](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s24/tree/main#assessment-and-evaluation)

### Part 1 • Experiment / Reflect (Partners Optional)

- Continue to work with sensor triggers and take a series of images, but add
  color this week. **Be deliberate about your color choices and placement in the
  composition(s)** to help tell a story (or part of one) or to convey an idea. Focus on one dominant color or work with a color scheme
  (check [our Miro board](https://tinyurl.com/xphoto-s24-miro) for reference).
- Work with the same sensor, a new one, or several at time. Continue to
  consider: how is triggering the capture the result of a change (or inactivity)
  in the environment or an action (or reaction) of the body? Is the triggering
  active or passive? How does the choice of sensor and its context in the world
  contribute to the intentions or expressions of the image? The only rule is: no
  buttons or toggle switches on your Arduino to trigger captures.
- Choose one of the images to submit for the assignment. Write a short
  reflection on your process and results. What does the image show? Why do you
  like the image? What qualities do you like best (see [Elements of a
  Photograph](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s24/blob/main/resources/photograph-elements.md))?
  Why and how are you using color? What did you have trouble with? What would
  you do differently next time? Describe the experience of creating the images?
  What did you feel? What was surprising, enjoyable, or challenging?
- If you work with a partner, each person needs to submit an assignment.
- Submit your image and reflection on
  [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/344680).

### Part 2 • [Read](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qIvZPNF94dAizOjOpymky5bexo8bdELj) / Respond

- PART 1: CHOICE of two (2) readings:
  - Read
    - "The Changing Gaze: From Documentary Photography to Voyeurism to
    Surveillance" by Ann-Christin Bertrand
    - OR “The Machine Sensorium” by James Bridle
  - Respond 1
    - Both of these essays are from the exhibition catalog accompanying,
      [_Watched! Surveillance, Art &
      Photography_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCVnV7Vl7HE) (2016). Using
      examples from either of these two readings, describe the changing nature
      of the "photographic gaze". Consider the role of distance, public and
      private conditions, power relations, "persistance of vision" (Bridle), the
      information/data an image contains, and the contexts in which images are
      made and distributed (Bertrand).
  - Respond 2
    - What is your response to the idea that non-human operated remote cameras
      are more "objective" and "authentic"? Is your response informed by your
      own relationship to surveillance practices (visual and non-visual)? If so, how?
- PART 2: Question
  - Next week artist [Jason Isolini](https://jisolini.com) will visit and share
    his work with our class. Review and interact(!) with his project, [The Ballard
    of a Laborer](https://jisolini.com/#/ballad-of-loosii-ninjas/), and come up
    with at least one (1) question to ask him during his visit. Include this
    question in your reading response.
- Submit your response and question for Jason on
  [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/344680).

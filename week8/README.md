# Mar 14 • Week 8 • AR Camera

> Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience that combines the real
> world and computer-generated content... AR can be defined as a system that
> incorporates three basic features: a combination of real and virtual worlds,
> real-time interaction, and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real
> objects. The overlaid sensory information can be **constructive** (i.e.
> additive to the natural environment), or **destructive** (i.e. masking of the
> natural environment). This experience is seamlessly interwoven with the
> physical world such that it is perceived as an immersive aspect of the real
> environment. In this way, augmented reality alters one's ongoing perception of
> a real-world environment, whereas virtual reality completely replaces the
> user's real-world environment with a simulated one.

## Questions

- How can we create AR objects with photographic material?
- How can we combine those objects with the "real" world in _constructive_ and
  _deconstructive_ ways for creative expression?

## In class

- Workshop: AR Camera
- Artist Talk: [Kat Mustatea](https://www.mustatea.com/)

### Part 1 • Experiment / Reflect

- There are two (2) experiments this week:
  - Class introduced the very basics of creating AR objects with photographic
    material in Adobe Aero. Your challenge and opportunity is to experiment with
    possibilities well beyond this starting point. For example, into how many
    pieces can you cut up an image? How many times can you duplicate those
    pieces, and what are all the ways you can manipulate and/or reassemble them
    to create new AR objects? Are there other ways to treat the images with blur
    or color adjustments, etc.?
  - You do not have to use Adobe Aero. If you are familiar with a different AR
    platform, feel free to use that instead.
- Experiment 1: Still Life
  - Construct a 3D still life in AR from photographic material.
  - Pick a theme for the still life objects and focus on one [element of
    photography](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s24/blob/main/resources/photograph-elements.md).
  - Photograph this still life through your AR app. Be intentional about the
    setting.
- Experiment 2: Portrait
  - Photograph a portrait of yourself or someone else through your AR app.
  - Include AR assets created from photographic material. Will your AR assets be
    additive (constructive) or masking (destructive)? Or both?
  - For a constructive approach, is anything being amplified, enhanced,
    duplicated? For a mask, perhaps consider the  personal and cultural
    significance of masks for ritual and to explore identity, hide, entertain,
    frighten, etc. Just some ideas to get you started.
  - Maybe switch the anchor type to a vertical surface in the object's
    Properties in Adobe Aero? (see related video above)
- As always, reflect on your process.
- Submit everything on
  [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/344680).

### Part 2 • Research / Respond

- To prepare for our next unit after spring break, take your picture in a
  classic photo booth. Plan ahead to not leave this to the last minute.
  - To start, here's a [list of possible
    options](https://tinybeans.com/new-york/nyc-photo-booths/) and [another list
    of
    options](https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=bars+with+photobooths&find_loc=New+York%2C+NY)
    around town. Consider calling ahead to confirm that these locations still
    offer photo booths.
  - TIP: The closest one to our classroom is a short walk to DeKalb Market
    Hall at City Point, downstairs and near the entrance to Trader
    Joe's.
- Respond
  - Write at least 15 observations about the experience. What do you
    notice and why? Consider photographic elements. Consider details. Consider
    constraints. Consider movement. Consider others' participation if there's
    any. What else? Use your senses if you get stuck.
  - Similar to close-looking activity in [Week
    2](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s24/tree/main/week2#part-2--read--respond),
    start with the obvious and then spend time digging below the surface of this
    experience.
  - Also reflect: is this experience any different from taking a selfie with
    your mobile camera or another device? Why or why not?
  - Include at least one (1) question for discussion or further
    reflection.
  - Be prepared to share your research findings in class.
- Submit your photo booth images and reflection on
  [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/344680).
